!!!IMPORTANT!!!

- second, the engine for image-to-text recognition is Tesseract-OCR, available here https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki for download, the version used is tesseract v4.0.0-beta.1.20180608 but any 4.x.x future updates should work
- third, the library used for image processing is OpenCV 3.4.2, but future versions should work as well 
All code was written on a Windows 10 64bit machine, might be different for other OS
